They grow up in the dusty, dirty, violent wilds, where death and desolation are just parts of everyday life.</p> <p>Badlanders are typically born to parents who once lived in the cities, but due to financial problems, were forced to move away from the safety of the city streets and try their luck in the radiated wilderness.</p> <p>Badlander clothing and housing is made from garbage dumped in the wilds by the megacity trash collectors.</p> <p>The ability to reuse and recycle waste into some thing of use is very common among badlanders.</p>",
